Real-Time Communication : (w/o refreshing)
1. Send the GET request every 5 seconds(like Fetch) -> Polling[not real-time,snappy X,need for asking]
2. Web Sockets -> Receive events async (the new data is provided from server itself).

frontend(single user) -> event -> backend(ws)
backend -> emit event -> frontend(all users)

webRTC : The Event is Video/Audio

30 images/sec -> sent in real-time via web sockets.

ws/http -> uses TCP -> not ideal as TCP retries every failure like instagram page refresh.
webRTC -> uses UDP -> Skips missed data like one frame / chops as re-asking takes time.

webRTC : p2p -> Browsers talk to each other 

Browser A to B and not via a Server like http or ws.
